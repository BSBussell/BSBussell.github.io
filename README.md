# Bee's Site

If you are curious about me, just go to [site](https://bbussell.com). If you're interested in how this is built, this is a static export of my WordPress site generated with [Simply Static](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-static/).

I built my site this way in order to allow me to take advantage of my wordpress bag of tricks, while also keeping everything simple and fast.

## What's in your bag of tricks?

Well for this site specifically, I took advantage of:

* Divi

Ya, that was all. I use Divi because I appreciate the ease of use it offers combined with the code modules enabling me to insert custom web components as I need. So say I want a component that I don't know, [displays a list of my most reccently edited GitHub repo](https://www.bbussell.com#github-projects). I can quickly script that up and then drag it in like its a divi module.

I do have more tricks up my sleeve, but I didn't really need them for this site. Eventually I will probably start uploading some of my custom plugins and components to GitHub. But for now, I'm still working on making them production ready.
